## Task 5

```{r}
library(FactoMineR)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```



```{r}
data(tea)
dim(tea)
str(tea)

tea_time <-tea%>% dplyr::select(Tea, age, How, where, friends, breakfast)

summary(tea_time)
gather(tea_time) %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + facet_wrap("key", scales = "free") +geom_bar()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8))

mca <- MCA(tea_time, quanti.sup= 2, graph = FALSE)
summary(mca)
```

Of all variables,"where" correlated more strongly with dimension 1 (but also with dimension 3), whereas "How" correlated more with dimension 2."Tea" type correlated with dimension 3. All variables were significant in dim 1.
Chain store+tea shop was not significant for dim 2 nor for dim 3.
Tea with milk was not significant for dim 3.

```{r}
dimdesc(mca)
```

Age is significantly correlated with dim 2 (p<0.05) and dim 3 (p<0.001).

```{r}
plot(mca, invisible=c("ind"),habillage = "quali")
```
